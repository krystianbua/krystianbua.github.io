I am a PhD Student at the Institute of Economics, [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it/en).

I work in the fields of: macroeconomics, financialization, financial history, political economy of finance. I am also intrigued by all those non-economic domains that aim to analyze finance from a socio-economic perspective, from the sociology of finance to historical sociology and political science. My current research agenda is centered on both developed and developing countries.

I hold my Bachelor of Science in Economics from the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/en) and my Master's degree in Economics and Economic Policy from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage).
